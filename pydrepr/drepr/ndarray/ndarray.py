        1. The algorithm works by first retrieve original nd-array of the column called C.
        2. We get alignments between the column and other index columns; and make sure that the alignments are all 
        dimension alignments. If there are some alignments that are not dimension alignments, we fall back to doing join
        between multiple tables, this would be slow!.
        3. For each index column: ICi:
            1. We retrieve the aligned dimensions between the column C and the index column ICi, now if there is any 
            dimension in ICi that is not aligned (*-to-many), we have to replicate the value C to match that. 
            2. Then, we mark which dimension of C is linked to dimension of ICi.
        4. After the above step, we retrieve a nested list, each dimension in C is annotated with a bunch of aligned
           dimension of ICi. We want to swap these dimensions so that the dimensions are in order of the indexed ICi.
           However, we may run into the case where there may be overlapping between dimensions of ICi. For example:
            1 1 1 1
            |-|-|-|-|
                2 2 2

            we have to throw error because there is no way to handle that. It cannot be continuous when at one dimension,
            the list of indexed edges are not continuous e.g, at dim 2, it is indexed by both col 1 and 3 (missing col 2)

            In that case, the users should use other functions to handle the situation yourself.
